**Note: The ETL Process in this Folder is Deprecated**

The ETL process outlined in this folder is no longer the recommended method for data extraction, transformation, and loading. The project's data pipeline has been updated to utilize AWS Glue, which provides a more efficient and scalable solution.

While this folder will still serve as a reference for the manual ETL process, it will undergo various adjustments to align with the new pipeline and enable continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Only relevant code snippets will be retained, and any necessary information pertaining to the ETL process will be provided in due course.

Once the necessary updates and modifications have been made, this disclaimer will be removed, and the folder will contain up-to-date information on the ETL process using AWS Glue.


Please note that this deprecation notice only applies to the ETL process in this specific folder. The overall project's goals and objectives remain unchanged.
